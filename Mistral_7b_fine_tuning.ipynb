We want you to perform the traffic volume prediction task, considering the nearby environment and historical traffic volume data.\\n Context knowledge you could consider:\\n     - Traffic volume: the number of vehicles passing a specific region in an hour, usually ranging from 0 to 1000.\\n     - Traffic pattern characteristic: Traffic flow patterns in a city are influenced by various area attributes. Also, traffic volume has a periodic daily and weekly pattern.\\n     - Spatial temporal factors correlation: Traffic flow in an area will be affected by its nearby infrastructures, during specific periods for different areas. You should think about how the volume will change in a specific area, during a specific time.\\n       For examples,\\n             Airports, and train stations - increased volume on weekends and holidays.\\n             Residential areas - more activities during morning and evening rush hours.\\n             Commercial areas - busy during lunch hours and after-work periods.\\n             Educational locations - high volume during peak hours near schools.\\n Think carefully about the following questions about how spatial-temporal factors affect traffic flow.\\n     - What is the attribute of this area and what is the predicted time zone located in special periods (like rush hours, weekdays, weekends, and holidays)?\\n     - What are the traffic patterns of this area, and what is the change in different time slots?\\n     - What is the historical temporal trend according to temporal information, considering the weekdays,  around holidays?\n",
